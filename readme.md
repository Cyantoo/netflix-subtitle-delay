# Netflix Subtitle Delay

A mini tool to delay subtitles on Netflix's website, http://netflix.com.

As you may know, Netflix doesn't have this functionality by default, and sometimes being able to delay subtitle
streaming can be of great help, especially when you're trying to learn a new language.

This extension is only allowed to execute on the Netflix official website.
