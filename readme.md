# Netflix Subtitle Delay

Mini tool to delay subtitles on the Netflix official website.

As you may know, Netflix doesn't have this functionality by default, and sometimes being able to delay subtitle
streaming can be of great help, especially when you're trying to learn a new language.

This extension is only allowed to execute on the official website of Netflix and I hope they add the subtitle delay
options soon and make this extension useless :)
